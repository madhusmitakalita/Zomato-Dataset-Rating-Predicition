# Zomato-Dataset-Rating-Predicition

The intuition behind analyzing the dataset from Zomato is to infer knowledge about some very important factors that impact the overall operations and future growth of a restaurant through their ability to maintain a good ‘Rating’. The proposed solution uses some of the Machine Learning classification algorithms like – Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines(SVM), etc. to segregate restaurants into the aforementioned categories. The optimal solution is presented to the users by evaluating all the classifiers through metrics like Accuracy, Precision score, f1- score. Our solution also allows a new restaurant to predict their probable ‘rating’ category by using some of the important features like location of the establishment, type of restaurant,book table etc.
